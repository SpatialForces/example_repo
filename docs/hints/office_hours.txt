+ Introduction to the SAP + Esri Hackathon
- HANA SQL will be used to query well-known text identifiers (i.e., location.ST_Within(**))
- HANA SQL was demoed in HanaStudio
- ? Started showing db_scan clustering for POIs in Berlin within Pro

+ Benefits of Hana Spatial & Combine w/ AcrGIS
- Stressed how HANA is in-memory & fast
- Can build visual models instead of SQL query
- Stressed clustering again (grid, db_scan, kmeans)
- HANA Spatial architecture --> ArcGIS Enterprise --> [Desktop & Pro, Portal, SAP business-obj]
- Demoed a HANA web app that shows counts within polygons (demoing speed)

+ Deep Dive Mapping
- Options for building mapping apps: browser (configurable web apps, web AppBuilder), native (AppStudio)
- Native app building: ArcGIS Runtime sdk
- Browser app building: JS API, widgets, webGL,

+ GeoAI
- 1) Exploration: visual feature selection, hotspot analysis, spatiotemporal analysis
- 2) Prepare features
- 3) Extract features: use model builder
- 4) Feature selection: determine correlation of extracted features
- 5) AI model building
- 6) Post prediction action: ex. create a service area for results

+ Imagery
-- Object detection using DL: train TensorFlow CNN w/ manually bounded image features
--- Call Call model from Pro (on the fly with python api?)
--- Esri Spatial Analysis / Image Analysis allows exporting training data sets
--- Connect to ArcGIS Field Apps (e.g., Workforce + Collector)

+ Raster Data & ML
- AFL + Predictive Analysis Library (PAL) (ML)
- HANA Extended Machine Learning (EML), interfaces with TF via SQL
- HANA Predictive Analysis Library: https://help.sap.com/viewer/2cfbc5cf2bc14f028cfbe2a2bba60a50/1.0.12/en-US/c9eeed704f3f4ec39441434db8a874ad.html?q=SAP%20HANA%20predictive%20analysis%20library

+ Supercharge Mash-ups
- ArcGIS Business Analysis & Geo-enrichment documents
- Esri Demographic data (~100 variables / country)
- quick setup!: arcGIS online hosted proxy
