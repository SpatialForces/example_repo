Self Organizing Map (SOM)
Unsupervised learning technique

Good at: 
-Clustering

tends to favor equal sized clusters

__________________________________________________________________________
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Shallow feedforward network

Good at:
Regression, e.g. interpolation, inferring continuous fields from inputs
Classification, sorting, categorization

Drawbacks,
-Tends to smooth out feutures in regression problems
-Not as good at spatial relationships as CNNs
-Not as good at time-series as RNNs

Can handle 3-4D data out of the box

Convolutional neural network (CNN)
Deep learning technique a.k.a really finicky

Good at:
-Feature extraction e.g. building perimeters, roads, etc.
-Classification, labeling

Drawbacks:
-2d spatial data
-Memory intensive + difficult to train

note that there are ways of linking CNNs together and with other methods to handle 3-4D data
