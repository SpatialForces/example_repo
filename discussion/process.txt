Overall: People come back with more data & tune the parameters

Assumptions & methods:
- we make our own building profiles, SF is training data (clip land usse type o building type)
- Use the model to ingest landuse outside of SF (of what building use types) assign a probability that a landuse density 
- This will break down the % of each profile for each land use type
- Then, we use an assumption of what people are doing at different times of day, then assign to land cover type
- ? we aggregate to this to the grid resolution of the shaking data 

ML Usage:
- Use SF buildign data to train building profiles to land use
- NN for shake data


Assigning building profile probabilities to land use:
- Examine distribution of building types for each land use in SF
- Create a model (ML or linear aka logistic regression) to predict building profiles from land use
- Apply model to areas outside of SF



1) Aggregate population into grids
2) Assign building occupancy type percentages to population
3) Connect shaking to buildings & connect to populations
